    "# **Lead Quality Prediction – FicZon Inc**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Objective**\n",
    "- Automate the **lead quality evaluation** process using Machine Learning.  \n",
    "- Predict lead category (**High Potential vs Low Potential**) to help sales teams prioritize leads.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Problem Statement**\n",
    "- FicZon Inc faces a **drop in sales performance** due to increasing competition and manual lead evaluation.  \n",
    "- Current quality checks happen **post-sale and are subjective**.  \n",
    "- ML-based predictive classification aims to **improve conversion rates and sales productivity**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Dataset**\n",
    "- **Records:** 7,422  \n",
    "- **Features:** 9 (Created Date, Source, Mobile, Email, Sales Agent, Location, Delivery Mode, Product ID, Status)  \n",
    "- **Target column:** `Status` (categorical lead quality)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Steps in Project**\n",
    "1. **EDA:** Analyzed lead sources, agents, and status distribution to identify patterns.  \n",
    "2. **Data Cleaning:** Removed duplicates, handled missing values, mapped lead quality into binary categories.  \n",
    "3. **Feature Engineering:** Extracted date features & applied **Target Mean Encoding** for categorical variables.  \n",
    "4. **Model Building:** Tested multiple models – Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM, AdaBoost.  \n",
    "5. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluated using **Accuracy, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC**.  \n",
    "   - Best models achieved **~85–91% accuracy after tuning**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Outcome**\n",
    "- Models like **XGBoost** and **LightGBM** outperformed others, showing balanced metrics (**Accuracy/F1/ROC-AUC**).  \n",
    "- The ML system can now **score leads in real-time**, improving sales effectiveness and focusing efforts on high-potential leads.\n",
